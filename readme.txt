I NEED TO ADD LIKE A ICON (KIND OF LIKE AN ASTERISK ) FOR LICENCED AND NOT EXPIRED LICENSES VETS, AND ON ORDERING THEY SHOULD APPEAR FIRST
I NEED TO CHECK WHETHER A USER HAS A SET OF PERMISSIONS FOR A CERTAIN OBJECT EG CONSULTATION(IE USER.HASPERMS(LEAVE COMMENT FOR CONSULTATION)) BEFORE PERFORMING AN ACTION
LINK UPDATE OF VET'S SUCCESSFUL CONSULTATIONS TO SIGNALS.PY FILE 
FORM CHECKBOXES AND RADIO BUTTONS ARE ALITTLE OFF IN STYLING, I NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT 

IN THE CONSULTATION ROOM ON THE SIDE INSTEAD OF ONLY PREVIOUS CONSULTATIONS, I NEED TO ADD REFERRAL COLLEAGUES LIST TOO - This is partially solved
